// This file contains type definitions for your data.
// It describes the shape of the data, and what data type each property should accept.
// For simplicity of teaching, we're manually defining these types.
// However, these types are generated automatically if you're using an ORM such as Prisma.


// We probably don't need to define the types for the data in the app/lib/definitions.ts file because prisma automatically creates types for us.
// We're doing it here for the sake of teaching.

// export type Invoice = {
//   id: string;
//   customer_id: string;
//   amount: number;
//   date: string;
//   // In TypeScript, this is called a string union type.
//   // It means that the "status" property can only be one of the two strings: 'pending' or 'paid'.
//   status: 'pending' | 'paid';
// };
